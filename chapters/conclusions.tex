\chapter{Conclusions}
The prototype device successfully achieved its intended task, proving to be an effective solution to the growing issue of privacy violations through unauthorized microphone recordings.
The current version of the device meets all the desired properties: effectiveness, inaudibility to humans, portability, ease of use, low energy consumption, and affordability.
However, as emphasized throughout the report, the version of the implementation described here represents a prototype, developed with the knowledge, time, and budget available at the time.
Several areas for improvement have already been identified, including both existing issues and potential new features. 
These enhancements aim to make future versions of the device even more reliable, practical, and versatile across different scenarios.

The project has proven to be highly valuable in exploring and delving deeper into a cybersecurity field that is still frequently underestimated and overlooked.
The conducted research on microphone technology and state-of-the-art attacks targeting them, paired with the practical experience gained in developing the physical implementation of the device, has provided invaluable insights and a solid foundation for further exploration and innovation in this area of cybersecurity.
